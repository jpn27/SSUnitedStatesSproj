Basic Project Guidelines:
->All objects, lights, and environments - all things in a scene - must be a placement of a Unity prefab object

->Prefabs and raw content must be sorted into their appropriate folders at all times

->Build version number guidelines:
---->Build version number will progress +0.0.1 with each build that adds new content or prefabs to the project
---->Build version number will progress +0.1 with each build that adds new prefabs to a scene or fixes an existing bug
---->Build version number will progress +1 with each build that overhauls or adds a new play mechanic
---->Build version will drop decimals lower than the current update's. Ex: "Build1.1.5" updated by 0.1 becomes "Build1.2.0" // Ex: "Build 2.5.4" updated by 1 becomes "Build3.0.0"
---->Build version does NOT increment to total all actions taken in a current session, only a single instance of the most important action taken. Ex: Adding two new prefabs does not increment build by 0.0.2
