****All files should be organized with Maya's project structure****

->File Naming Structure for Models:

 -->m_"name of room"_"name of object"_"level of detail"_"state of completion"

 -->replace anything in quotes with the appropriate selection below:
    -->names of rooms:
       -->navajo
       -->hall
       -->theater
       -->shop
       -->duck
       -->ball
       -->prom
       -->bridge
       -->print
       -->exterior

    -->levels of detail:
       -->high
       -->medium (if we have medium)
       -->low

    -->states of completion:
       -->p = placeholder geometry 
       -->r = in the process of modeling, will be revised
       -->f = model and UVs completely finished, will not be updated

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

->File Naming Structure for Textures:

 -->t_"name of room"_"name of object"_"type of map"_"state of completion"

 -->Replace anything in quotes with the appropriate selection below:
    -->type of map:
       -->d = diffuse
       -->s = specular
       -->g = gloss
       -->i = incandescence
       -->o = opacity
       -->v = vector displacement
       -->b = bump
       -->n = normal
       -->r = reflection

    -->states of completion:
       -->p = placeholder texture
       -->r = in the process of texturing, will be revised
       -->f = texture completely finished, will not be updated
